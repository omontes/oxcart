Spain applied ‚ÄúColonias‚Äù and Portugal ‚Äúultramar‚Äù. Parker added that these overprints were quite scarce.

      "Albert J. Hart\\n\\nIn 1975 Alex A. Cohen asked the following question in the Oxcart under the heading ‚ÄúA mystery overprint‚Äù ref (1):\\nFechas: 1975. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\n‚Äú Recently, I noted the 2 and 5 colon values of the 1901 issue (Scott nos. 52 and 53 ) with a blue, single-line overprint, in caps, reading Ultramar. This is the first time I have ever seen these. Can any member furnish any information concerning them? ‚Äù\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 52. \\nFechas: 1901. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: blue. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nIn the next issue of the Oxcart ref (2) a letter from C. Angus Parker (1927 - 1995) , a British collector, dealer, and SOCORICO member, explained that the overprint was a hand struck cachet applied by Portuguese postal authorities to stamps circulated through the universal postal union (UPU) in Switzerland. The ‚Äúultamar stamps‚Äù were circulated to Portuguese overseas colonies and post offices as a security precaution.\\nFechas: 1927, 1995. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine.\\n\\nIn the next Oxcart ref (3), Cohen reported that he had met Parker and shown him the ultramar stamps. Parker, a specialist in this field, told Cohen the stamps were genuine, showing him Salvador stamps with the same overprint. Parker said both Spain and Portugal distributed stamps received from the UPU to their colonies with applied overprints at the turn of the century. Spain applied ‚ÄúColonias‚Äù and Portugal ‚Äúultramar‚Äù. Parker added that these overprints were quite scarce. Later that year more ultramar overprints were reported (Scott 61, 045, 046, and 047) in the Oxcart ref (4).\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 61, 045, 046. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nIn 1978 the ‚Äú ultramars ‚Äù were back as lot 125 of the Oxcart mail bid sale No 73 ref (5): the 1907 1c to 2 colone, (59/68) mixed perfs. All with target cancel in black in one corner, circulated as specimens through UPU, with\\nFechas: 1978, 1907. \\nValores faciales: 2.0 colones. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: black.\\n\\nHand stamp ultramar, i.e. ‚Äúoverseas‚Äù, security marking applied by Portuguese PO to stamps sent to it‚Äôs colonies and post offices abroad. A Real rarity. Estimated value $500,00‚Äù.\\nCondici√≥n: centrado good. \\nPrecios: $500,00.\\n\\nThe target cancels were applied in Costa Rica, probably as a security precaution to deter the stamps from passing to individuals who otherwise could use them to defraud the post office. Both the 14 x 14 and 11 x 14 perforations are known to have been used early in the life of the 1907 set, so the ‚Äú mixed perfs ‚Äù , is not unusual ref 6). Cohen was the sales manager at this time and had probably brought this lot (which sold for $ 510,00) from Europe and in 1980 he showed, ref (7) a photograph of the 1907 ultramar set fig (1). I have found no mention of the ultramar overprint in the Oxcart since that time.\\nFechas: 1980, 1907. \\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: dentado 14x14/14/11x14. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird. \\nPrecios: $ 510,00.\\n\\nThe George Alevizos public auction of July 7, 1994 brought new light to this dark corner of Costa Rican philately. Included in the sale were 137 lots which had originated in Angola, a former Portuguese overseas territory. Stamps in these lots were UPU samples from nations around the world with the ultamar hand stamp as well as five other hand stamps used in later periods. The auction catalogue defined the six Portuguese hand stamps and their period of use:\\nFechas: 1994. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine. \\nColores: dark, light.\\n\\n0\t1\n",

Since the Muestras represent the earliest printing, Mitchell was able to assign the shades of the 1 and 2 centavos stamps to either the first or second printing (2). It has also been suggested that Ross, purchaser of the first issue (Scott 1-4) remainders, may have used his government connections to obtain supplies of the 1883 Muestras for sale to the philatelic trade (3). Supporting this suggestion is Mitchell's observation that soon after their appearance the Muestras were listed as new varieties in British publications and briefly had a space in a Stanley Gibbons album (2).

When the 1907 Waterlow Brothers and Layton stamps were issued the UPU samples had neither the Muestra or Specimen overprint, possibly because a new printer for Costa Rica was involved and no arrangements for overprinting in England had been made. Instead the samples were ‚Äúoverprinted‚Äù in Costa Rica Using the four ring target cancel (1/4 of the target/stamp) which gave the samples a canceled- to-order look.

I have never found a documented proof for this observation. Mitchell also had inspected the Costa Rica Stock at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C. which was the repository for the UPU samples received by the United States (5).

In fact the second issue is the only general revenue set that is easy to complete and even sheets are not too difficult to find. However, this is deceptive as there are many interesting complications and some important rarities.\\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nThese two issues were lithographed by Bradbury, Wilkinson and Co. of England in sheets of 40 (10 x 40), perf 14.5 and they were imperf. at the edges. There was one general plate for the frames and the values in numbers and letters were added in a second plate. The 5c is in red and the others are in black. The frames must have been printed all at once as there are little or no shade variations.\\nValores faciales: 5.0 c. \\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: dentado 14.5/10x40, imperforate, lithography. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: red, black. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nGum is very thick on the first issue and color is beige and yellow. It is ‚Äú crinkled ‚Äù with lines and ridges over the surface, sometimes more pronounced than others. It may cause the front of the stamp to also have lines and wrinkles. fine brush lines in the gum indicates that it was applied by hand. It is quite possible that the stamps were shipped by the printer without gum, which was applied in CR. as needed. This would explain the large number of mint stamps, including sheets, which show no indication of ever having had gum applied.\\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: yellow. \\nDise√±os: barco/ship/vessel, ave/p√°jaro/bird. \n",

The event prompt- ing my inquiry was Scott's 2003 catalogue in- crease of the valuation of the ‚Äú used ‚Äù stamp to $ 100 from zero in the past two years. In years prior to 2000 it had a value as high as $ 125. The stamp in question is Scott # 87 (Mena 84, 84A). The question is whether or not this stamp ever saw postal use? Or put another way, what is it one is likely to buy when spending $ 100 for this ‚Äú used ‚Äù stamp? A summary of my brief re- view of the existing literature follows.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 2003, 87. \\nFechas: 2000, 2003, 1907, 1911. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine, defectos: crease. \\nColores: blue, black. \\nPrecios: $ 100, $ 125., $ 100.\\n\\nDecree No. 228 of November 11, 1910 author ized the surcharging of 285,000 telegraph stamps of 1910 of different values with ‚Äú Correos ‚Äì Un centimo ‚Äù : an issue date of Novem ber 14, 1911 is given in Mena. $^1$\\nFechas: 1910, 1911. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nTwo plates were used in the surcharging op- eration. Plate 1 (narrow character spacing) was used on six of the seven values. Peralta says: ‚Äú Please note that the overprints in black on the 10c stamp are very rare, they were not used postally, but are to be found with original gum, with ‚Äú favor cancels ‚Äù . He later says: ‚Äú For the purpose of identifying these, the favor cancella- tion invariably applied ‚Äì to these and all the rest of the speculative stamps of this issue ‚Äì is the long rectangle that was in use in that period, with the legend ‚Äú San Jose, C.
