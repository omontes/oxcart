      "Albert J. Hart\\n\\nIn 1975 Alex A. Cohen asked the following question in the Oxcart under the heading ‚ÄúA mystery overprint‚Äù ref (1):\\nFechas: 1975. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\n‚Äú Recently, I noted the 2 and 5 colon values of the 1901 issue (Scott nos. 52 and 53 ) with a blue, single-line overprint, in caps, reading Ultramar. This is the first time I have ever seen these. Can any member furnish any information concerning them? ‚Äù\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 52. \\nFechas: 1901. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: blue. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nIn the next issue of the Oxcart ref (2) a letter from C. Angus Parker (1927 - 1995) , a British collector, dealer, and SOCORICO member, explained that the overprint was a hand struck cachet applied by Portuguese postal authorities to stamps circulated through the universal postal union (UPU) in Switzerland. The ‚Äúultamar stamps‚Äù were circulated to Portuguese overseas colonies and post offices as a security precaution.\\nFechas: 1927, 1995. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine.\\n\\nIn the next Oxcart ref (3), Cohen reported that he had met Parker and shown him the ultramar stamps. Parker, a specialist in this field, told Cohen the stamps were genuine, showing him Salvador stamps with the same overprint.

Angus Parker (1927 - 1995) , a British collector, dealer, and SOCORICO member, explained that the overprint was a hand struck cachet applied by Portuguese postal authorities to stamps circulated through the universal postal union (UPU) in Switzerland. The ‚Äúultamar stamps‚Äù were circulated to Portuguese overseas colonies and post offices as a security precaution.\\nFechas: 1927, 1995. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine.\\n\\nIn the next Oxcart ref (3), Cohen reported that he had met Parker and shown him the ultramar stamps.

      "Albert J. Hart\\n\\nIn 1975 Alex A. Cohen asked the following question in the Oxcart under the heading ‚ÄúA mystery overprint‚Äù ref (1):\\nFechas: 1975. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\n‚Äú Recently, I noted the 2 and 5 colon values of the 1901 issue (Scott nos. 52 and 53 ) with a blue, single-line overprint, in caps, reading Ultramar. This is the first time I have ever seen these. Can any member furnish any information concerning them? ‚Äù\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 52. \\nFechas: 1901. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: blue. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nIn the next issue of the Oxcart ref (2) a letter from C. Angus Parker (1927 - 1995) , a British collector, dealer, and SOCORICO member, explained that the overprint was a hand struck cachet applied by Portuguese postal authorities to stamps circulated through the universal postal union (UPU) in Switzerland. The ‚Äúultamar stamps‚Äù were circulated to Portuguese overseas colonies and post offices as a security precaution.\\nFechas: 1927, 1995. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine.\\n\\nIn the next Oxcart ref (3), Cohen reported that he had met Parker and shown him the ultramar stamps. Parker, a specialist in this field, told Cohen the stamps were genuine, showing him Salvador stamps with the same overprint. Parker said both Spain and Portugal distributed stamps received from the UPU to their colonies with applied overprints at the turn of the century. Spain applied ‚ÄúColonias‚Äù and Portugal ‚Äúultramar‚Äù. Parker added that these overprints were quite scarce. Later that year more ultramar overprints were reported (Scott 61, 045, 046, and 047) in the Oxcart ref (4).\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 61, 045, 046. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nIn 1978 the ‚Äú ultramars ‚Äù were back as lot 125 of the Oxcart mail bid sale No 73 ref (5): the 1907 1c to 2 colone, (59/68) mixed perfs. All with target cancel in black in one corner, circulated as specimens through UPU, with\\nFechas: 1978, 1907. \\nValores faciales: 2.0 colones. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: black.\\n\\nHand stamp ultramar, i.e. ‚Äúoverseas‚Äù, security marking applied by Portuguese PO to stamps sent to it‚Äôs colonies and post offices abroad. A Real rarity. Estimated value $500,00‚Äù.\\nCondici√≥n: centrado good. \\nPrecios: $500,00.\\n\\nThe target cancels were applied in Costa Rica, probably as a security precaution to deter the stamps from passing to individuals who otherwise could use them to defraud the post office. Both the 14 x 14 and 11 x 14 perforations are known to have been used early in the life of the 1907 set, so the ‚Äú mixed perfs ‚Äù , is not unusual ref 6). Cohen was the sales manager at this time and had probably brought this lot (which sold for $ 510,00) from Europe and in 1980 he showed, ref (7) a photograph of the 1907 ultramar set fig (1). I have found no mention of the ultramar overprint in the Oxcart since that time.\\nFechas: 1980, 1907. \\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: dentado 14x14/14/11x14. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird. \\nPrecios: $ 510,00.\\n\\nThe George Alevizos public auction of July 7, 1994 brought new light to this dark corner of Costa Rican philately. Included in the sale were 137 lots which had originated in Angola, a former Portuguese overseas territory. Stamps in these lots were UPU samples from nations around the world with the ultamar hand stamp as well as five other hand stamps used in later periods. The auction catalogue defined the six Portuguese hand stamps and their period of use:\\nFechas: 1994. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine. \\nColores: dark, light.\\n\\n0\t1\n",

The UPU then distributed the samples to member nations to provide examples of valid stamps expected in international mail. The UPU distribution of the world's new issues continued until 1992 (1), though some nations discontinued supplying samples earlier.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 16-20. \\nFechas: 1883, 1992. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nThe Fernandez stamp samples were overprinted Mucstra as were the postal cards also issued early in 1883 (Mena M 12-16 and MPC 1-2). Since the Muestras represent the earliest printing, Mitchell was able to assign the shades of the 1 and 2 centavos stamps to either the first or second printing (2). It has also been suggested that Ross, purchaser of the first issue (Scott 1-4) remainders, may have used his government connections to obtain supplies of the 1883 Muestras for sale to the philatelic trade (3). Supporting this suggestion is Mitchell's observation that soon after their appearance the Muestras were listed as new varieties in British publications and briefly had a space in a Stanley Gibbons album (2). UPU samples have leaked to the philatelic market, but usually after a long time period involving post office employees.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 1-4. \\nFechas: 1883. \\nValores faciales: 2.0 centavos. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird. \\nPrecios:  centavos2.\\n\\nUPU samples of the 1889 Soto issue were overprinted Specimen, not Muestra, and probably in England where the stamps were manufactured. When the 1907 Waterlow Brothers and Layton stamps were issued the UPU samples had neither the Muestra or Specimen overprint, possibly because a new printer for Costa Rica was involved and no arrangements for overprinting in England had been made. Instead the samples were ‚Äúoverprinted‚Äù in Costa Rica Using the four ring target cancel (1/4 of the target/stamp) which gave the samples a canceled- to-order look.

Since the Muestras represent the earliest printing, Mitchell was able to assign the shades of the 1 and 2 centavos stamps to either the first or second printing (2). It has also been suggested that Ross, purchaser of the first issue (Scott 1-4) remainders, may have used his government connections to obtain supplies of the 1883 Muestras for sale to the philatelic trade (3). Supporting this suggestion is Mitchell's observation that soon after their appearance the Muestras were listed as new varieties in British publications and briefly had a space in a Stanley Gibbons album (2).

In years prior to 2000 it had a value as high as $ 125. The stamp in question is Scott # 87 (Mena 84, 84A). The question is whether or not this stamp ever saw postal use?

The UPU then distributed the samples to member nations to provide examples of valid stamps expected in international mail. The UPU distribution of the world's new issues continued until 1992 (1), though some nations discontinued supplying samples earlier.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 16-20. \\nFechas: 1883, 1992. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nThe Fernandez stamp samples were overprinted Mucstra as were the postal cards also issued early in 1883 (Mena M 12-16 and MPC 1-2). Since the Muestras represent the earliest printing, Mitchell was able to assign the shades of the 1 and 2 centavos stamps to either the first or second printing (2). It has also been suggested that Ross, purchaser of the first issue (Scott 1-4) remainders, may have used his government connections to obtain supplies of the 1883 Muestras for sale to the philatelic trade (3). Supporting this suggestion is Mitchell's observation that soon after their appearance the Muestras were listed as new varieties in British publications and briefly had a space in a Stanley Gibbons album (2). UPU samples have leaked to the philatelic market, but usually after a long time period involving post office employees.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 1-4. \\nFechas: 1883. \\nValores faciales: 2.0 centavos. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird. \\nPrecios:  centavos2.\\n\\nUPU samples of the 1889 Soto issue were overprinted Specimen, not Muestra, and probably in England where the stamps were manufactured. When the 1907 Waterlow Brothers and Layton stamps were issued the UPU samples had neither the Muestra or Specimen overprint, possibly because a new printer for Costa Rica was involved and no arrangements for overprinting in England had been made. Instead the samples were ‚Äúoverprinted‚Äù in Costa Rica Using the four ring target cancel (1/4 of the target/stamp) which gave the samples a canceled- to-order look. Collectable copies of these stamps would have gum (the norm for UPU samples) since the target was also used as a regular\\nFechas: 1889, 1907. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine. \\nColores: red. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\ncancel during this period, (4).\\nCondici√≥n: centrado good.\\n\\nMitchell and Quigley reported (4) that the 11X14 and 14 perforations for the 1907 issue were contemporary; i.e. , both were in use during the time span of the stamps. this was based on the observation of stamps on cover and of off- cover stamps with legible cancels. I have never found a documented proof for this observation. Mitchell also had inspected the Costa Rica Stock at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C. which was the repository for the UPU samples received by the United States (5). He found the 1907 stamps with full gum and the target cancel, but did not report on the perforations.\\nFechas: 1907. \\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: dentado 11x14/14. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nIn 1988 H.T.

Costa Rica sent their 1907 samples to the UPU for world wide distribution and the USA samples ended up at the Smithsonian. Portugal sent some of their samples to their overseas territories with the Ultramar overprint (7). I have never seen any of these actual stamps but it is easy to visually differentiate between the 11X14 and the 14 perforations and no perforation gauge is needed when viewing the photo copy of the Ultramar stamps in Oxcart 79 or Oxcart 157.\\nFechas: 1907. \\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: dentado 11x14/14. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nThe comparison between the Smithsonian and the Ultramar stamps is shown in the table below.

One explanation for the short life of the set relates to a scandal involving the concurrent revenue stamps from the same printer (Waterlow Brothers and Layton), but this explanation has been challenged.

      "James A. Quigley Part I) (As printed in Weekly Philatelic Gossip, June 16, 1945\\nFechas: 1945.\\n\\nOften the story behind the stamps is of more interest than the dry listing in the catalogue would seem to indicate. Such is certainly the case in regard to the Costa Rican issue of 1907. This set.is listed by Scott as numbers 59 to 68. The stamps surcharged OFICIAL and listed as numbers 048 to 055 were produced by the same manufacturer under the same contract and should be regarded as part of the same issue. Likewise, the telegraph stamps Scotts type A62 used later to produce the surcharges of 1911 were part of this same issue. A set of revenue stamps were also produced by the same engraving firm. And thereby hangs a tale as the story writers say.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: A 62. \\nFechas: 1907, 1911. \\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: engraved. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine.\\n\\nAround the turn of the century the engraving and printing firm of Waterlow Brothers and Layton Ltd., was established in London. One is immediately struck by the similarity in name between this firm and the old established house of Waterlow and Sons. It is not known that Waterlow Brothers and Layton deliberately intended to make use of this sim- ilarity in name, but at any rate just such a confusion as could be anticipated was made by the Costa Rican authorities. Waterlow Brothers and Layton sent an agent to San Jose to solicit business from the Costa Rican Government. Under the impression that this agent represented the old reputable firm of Waterlow and Sons a contract was entered into for the production of a series of postage, telegraph, official and revenue stamps.\\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: engraved. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: red.\\n\\nThis issue was authorized by Decree #2 dated September 28, 1907. The first day of issue was October 1st. The stamps were well manufactured on a good grade of paper and with their pleasing two color combination are a fine addition to any collectors album.\\nFechas: 1907. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine. \\nColores: red.\\n\\nAll went well until March, 1910. At that time the authorities uncovered a con- spiracy to defraud the National Treasury by the sale of revenue stamps by private parties. These revenue stamps were apparently similar in every respect to those in the hands of the National Treasury. The conclusion was at once reached that the stamps in the hands of the conspirators were produced from the original plates which were supposed to be in the custody of the manufacturers in London. Further investigation revealed that the par- ties to the conspiracy were a prominent government official who held a position of trust in the National Stamp Office and some persons in the offices of the stamp manufacturers in London. These findings were verified when it was ascertained that the stamps illegally sold were not abstracted from the Government vaults but had been smuggled into Costa Rica from an outside source.\\nFechas: 1910. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: red. \n",

In fact the second issue is the only general revenue set that is easy to complete and even sheets are not too difficult to find. However, this is deceptive as there are many interesting complications and some important rarities.\\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nThese two issues were lithographed by Bradbury, Wilkinson and Co. of England in sheets of 40 (10 x 40), perf 14.5 and they were imperf. at the edges. There was one general plate for the frames and the values in numbers and letters were added in a second plate. The 5c is in red and the others are in black. The frames must have been printed all at once as there are little or no shade variations.\\nValores faciales: 5.0 c. \\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: dentado 14.5/10x40, imperforate, lithography. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: red, black. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nGum is very thick on the first issue and color is beige and yellow. It is ‚Äú crinkled ‚Äù with lines and ridges over the surface, sometimes more pronounced than others. It may cause the front of the stamp to also have lines and wrinkles. fine brush lines in the gum indicates that it was applied by hand. It is quite possible that the stamps were shipped by the printer without gum, which was applied in CR. as needed. This would explain the large number of mint stamps, including sheets, which show no indication of ever having had gum applied.\\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: yellow. \\nDise√±os: barco/ship/vessel, ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nBradbury reported having printed 100,000 to 200,000 of the values to 25 pesos but only 1,000 each of the 50 & 100 peso stamps. The rarity of these two high values supports this.\\nValores faciales: 25.0 pesos, 100.0 pesos. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nThe stamps were authorized from March 1, 1870 but their use was abolished only 3 months later on June 2. This creates the first rarity; copies used during this period. Bonilla reports a 10c with an April 8 th date and I can report a 25c with a (Mar) 29/70 date (fig. 2 ). They both correspond to the decree requiring that the stamps be canceled with a signature and date. This is a rarity a collector might find with a large amount of luck and a small amount of money.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: A 10c, 25c. \\nFechas: 1870. \\nValores faciales: 10.0 c, 25.0 c. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine. \\nPrecios: c1, c2.\\n\\nThe 50c with green frame does exist. the color is identical to the light green of the 25c so it is almost certainly an actual error and not an essay. The ‚Äúgreen‚Äù, listed by Bonilla for the 10 peso is actually a blue-green and completely different. This stamp is a great rarity, Certainly not more than one sheet existed.

In years prior to 2000 it had a value as high as $ 125. The stamp in question is Scott # 87 (Mena 84, 84A). The question is whether or not this stamp ever saw postal use? Or put another way, what is it one is likely to buy when spending $ 100 for this ‚Äú used ‚Äù stamp?

Angus Parker (1927 - 1995) , a British collector, dealer, and SOCORICO member, explained that the overprint was a hand struck cachet applied by Portuguese postal authorities to stamps circulated through the universal postal union (UPU) in Switzerland. The ‚Äúultamar stamps‚Äù were circulated to Portuguese overseas colonies and post offices as a security precaution.\\nFechas: 1927, 1995. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine.\\n\\nIn the next Oxcart ref (3), Cohen reported that he had met Parker and shown him the ultramar stamps. Parker, a specialist in this field, told Cohen the stamps were genuine, showing him Salvador stamps with the same overprint. Parker said both Spain and Portugal distributed stamps received from the UPU to their colonies with applied overprints at the turn of the century. Spain applied ‚ÄúColonias‚Äù and Portugal ‚Äúultramar‚Äù. Parker added that these overprints were quite scarce. Later that year more ultramar overprints were reported (Scott 61, 045, 046, and 047) in the Oxcart ref (4).\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 61, 045, 046. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nIn 1978 the ‚Äú ultramars ‚Äù were back as lot 125 of the Oxcart mail bid sale No 73 ref (5): the 1907 1c to 2 colone, (59/68) mixed perfs.

      "Albert J. Hart\\n\\nIn 1975 Alex A. Cohen asked the following question in the Oxcart under the heading ‚ÄúA mystery overprint‚Äù ref (1):\\nFechas: 1975. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\n‚Äú Recently, I noted the 2 and 5 colon values of the 1901 issue (Scott nos. 52 and 53 ) with a blue, single-line overprint, in caps, reading Ultramar.

Angus Parker (1927 - 1995) , a British collector, dealer, and SOCORICO member, explained that the overprint was a hand struck cachet applied by Portuguese postal authorities to stamps circulated through the universal postal union (UPU) in Switzerland. The ‚Äúultamar stamps‚Äù were circulated to Portuguese overseas colonies and post offices as a security precaution.\\nFechas: 1927, 1995. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine.\\n\\nIn the next Oxcart ref (3), Cohen reported that he had met Parker and shown him the ultramar stamps. Parker, a specialist in this field, told Cohen the stamps were genuine, showing him Salvador stamps with the same overprint. Parker said both Spain and Portugal distributed stamps received from the UPU to their colonies with applied overprints at the turn of the century. Spain applied ‚ÄúColonias‚Äù and Portugal ‚Äúultramar‚Äù. Parker added that these overprints were quite scarce. Later that year more ultramar overprints were reported (Scott 61, 045, 046, and 047) in the Oxcart ref (4).\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 61, 045, 046. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nIn 1978 the ‚Äú ultramars ‚Äù were back as lot 125 of the Oxcart mail bid sale No 73 ref (5): the 1907 1c to 2 colone, (59/68) mixed perfs.

Included in the sale were 137 lots which had originated in Angola, a former Portuguese overseas territory. Stamps in these lots were UPU samples from nations around the world with the ultamar hand stamp as well as five other hand stamps used in later periods. The auction catalogue defined the six Portuguese hand stamps and their period of use:\\nFechas: 1994. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine. \\nColores: dark, light. \n",

      "James A. Quigley Part I) (As printed in Weekly Philatelic Gossip, June 16, 1945\\nFechas: 1945.\\n\\nOften the story behind the stamps is of more interest than the dry listing in the catalogue would seem to indicate. Such is certainly the case in regard to the Costa Rican issue of 1907. This set.is listed by Scott as numbers 59 to 68. The stamps surcharged OFICIAL and listed as numbers 048 to 055 were produced by the same manufacturer under the same contract and should be regarded as part of the same issue. Likewise, the telegraph stamps Scotts type A62 used later to produce the surcharges of 1911 were part of this same issue. A set of revenue stamps were also produced by the same engraving firm. And thereby hangs a tale as the story writers say.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: A 62. \\nFechas: 1907, 1911. \\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: engraved. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine.\\n\\nAround the turn of the century the engraving and printing firm of Waterlow Brothers and Layton Ltd., was established in London. One is immediately struck by the similarity in name between this firm and the old established house of Waterlow and Sons. It is not known that Waterlow Brothers and Layton deliberately intended to make use of this sim- ilarity in name, but at any rate just such a confusion as could be anticipated was made by the Costa Rican authorities. Waterlow Brothers and Layton sent an agent to San Jose to solicit business from the Costa Rican Government. Under the impression that this agent represented the old reputable firm of Waterlow and Sons a contract was entered into for the production of a series of postage, telegraph, official and revenue stamps.\\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: engraved. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: red.\\n\\nThis issue was authorized by Decree #2 dated September 28, 1907. The first day of issue was October 1st. The stamps were well manufactured on a good grade of paper and with their pleasing two color combination are a fine addition to any collectors album.\\nFechas: 1907. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine. \\nColores: red.\\n\\nAll went well until March, 1910. At that time the authorities uncovered a con- spiracy to defraud the National Treasury by the sale of revenue stamps by private parties. These revenue stamps were apparently similar in every respect to those in the hands of the National Treasury. The conclusion was at once reached that the stamps in the hands of the conspirators were produced from the original plates which were supposed to be in the custody of the manufacturers in London. Further investigation revealed that the par- ties to the conspiracy were a prominent government official who held a position of trust in the National Stamp Office and some persons in the offices of the stamp manufacturers in London. These findings were verified when it was ascertained that the stamps illegally sold were not abstracted from the Government vaults but had been smuggled into Costa Rica from an outside source.\\nFechas: 1910. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: red.\\n\\nAs a measure of security the revenue stamps were immediately demonetized. The local press immediately began to agitate for the recall of all the issues manufactured by Waterlow Brothers and Layton: The Government acceded to this agitation and the postal issue was likewise recalled and demonetized. As soon as the manufacturers learned that the Government had recalled the issue they began to sell these stamps openly. The\\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: red.\\n\\nstamps thus sold irregularly were principally those mentioned in footnotes in Scott and Gibbons catalogues, 1.e. imperforate and inverted center, and on various colored papers.\\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: imperforate. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado good. \\nVariedades EFO: centro invertido (confianza: 0.9); sin dentar (confianza: 0.8). \\nColores: red. \n",

The event prompt- ing my inquiry was Scott's 2003 catalogue in- crease of the valuation of the ‚Äú used ‚Äù stamp to $ 100 from zero in the past two years. In years prior to 2000 it had a value as high as $ 125. The stamp in question is Scott # 87 (Mena 84, 84A). The question is whether or not this stamp ever saw postal use? Or put another way, what is it one is likely to buy when spending $ 100 for this ‚Äú used ‚Äù stamp? A summary of my brief re- view of the existing literature follows.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 2003, 87. \\nFechas: 2000, 2003, 1907, 1911. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine, defectos: crease. \\nColores: blue, black. \\nPrecios: $ 100, $ 125., $ 100.\\n\\nDecree No. 228 of November 11, 1910 author ized the surcharging of 285,000 telegraph stamps of 1910 of different values with ‚Äú Correos ‚Äì Un centimo ‚Äù : an issue date of Novem ber 14, 1911 is given in Mena. $^1$\\nFechas: 1910, 1911. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nTwo plates were used in the surcharging op- eration. Plate 1 (narrow character spacing) was used on six of the seven values. Peralta says: ‚Äú Please note that the overprints in black on the 10c stamp are very rare, they were not used postally, but are to be found with original gum, with ‚Äú favor cancels ‚Äù . He later says: ‚Äú For the purpose of identifying these, the favor cancella- tion invariably applied ‚Äì to these and all the rest of the speculative stamps of this issue ‚Äì is the long rectangle that was in use in that period, with the legend ‚Äú San Jose, C. R., the date, and six parallel lines ‚Äù . Plate 2 (wide spacing) was used exclusively for the 10c blue telegraph stamp, normally with red ink and occasionally with black. These surcharges are very rare and the remarks made about plate 1 apply here. ‚Äù 2\\nValores faciales: 10.0 c, 10.0 c. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine. \\nColores: blue, red, black. \\nPrecios: c1, c1.\\n\\nPeralta lists 14 varieties (or errors) on the method of surcharging with plate 1 and then says at number 15: ‚Äú Besides the foregoing ‚Äì which occur in the normal colors ‚Äì there is the important variety of surcharge in black on the 10c stamp, for which none of the variety of printing methods is known ‚Äù .

These findings were verified when it was ascertained that the stamps illegally sold were not abstracted from the Government vaults but had been smuggled into Costa Rica from an outside source.\\nFechas: 1910. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: red.\\n\\nAs a measure of security the revenue stamps were immediately demonetized. The local press immediately began to agitate for the recall of all the issues manufactured by Waterlow Brothers and Layton: The Government acceded to this agitation and the postal issue was likewise recalled and demonetized.

      "         üìù Texto: BY GIANA WAYMAN\\n\\nStrangely the first two revenue issues of Costa Rica are the most common. In fact the second issue is the only general revenue set that is easy to complete and even sheets are not too difficult to find. However, this is deceptive as there are many interesting complications and some important rarities.\\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nThese two issues were lithographed by Bradbury, Wilkinson and Co. of England in sheets of 40 (10 x 40), perf 14.5 and they were imperf. at the edges. There was one general plate for the frames and the values in numbers and letters were added in a second plate. The 5c is in red and the others are in black. The frames must have been printed all at once as there are little or no shade variations.\\nValores faciales: 5.0 c. \\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: dentado 14.5/10x40, imperforate, lithography. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: red, black. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nGum is very thick on the first issue and color is beige and yellow. It is ‚Äú crinkled ‚Äù with lines and ridges over the surface, sometimes more pronounced than others. It may cause the front of the stamp to also have lines and wrinkles. fine brush lines in the gum indicates that it was applied by hand. It is quite possible that the stamps were shipped by the printer without gum, which was applied in CR. as needed. This would explain the large number of mint stamps, including sheets, which show no indication of ever having had gum applied.\\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: yellow. \\nDise√±os: barco/ship/vessel, ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nBradbury reported having printed 100,000 to 200,000 of the values to 25 pesos but only 1,000 each of the 50 & 100 peso stamps. The rarity of these two high values supports this.\\nValores faciales: 25.0 pesos, 100.0 pesos. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nThe stamps were authorized from March 1, 1870 but their use was abolished only 3 months later on June 2. This creates the first rarity; copies used during this period. Bonilla reports a 10c with an April 8 th date and I can report a 25c with a (Mar) 29/70 date (fig. 2 ). They both correspond to the decree requiring that the stamps be canceled with a signature and date. This is a rarity a collector might find with a large amount of luck and a small amount of money.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: A 10c, 25c. \\nFechas: 1870. \\nValores faciales: 10.0 c, 25.0 c. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine. \\nPrecios: c1, c2.\\n\\nThe 50c with green frame does exist. the color is identical to the light green of the 25c so it is almost certainly an actual error and not an essay. The ‚Äúgreen‚Äù, listed by Bonilla for the 10 peso is actually a blue-green and completely different. This stamp is a great rarity, Certainly not more than one sheet existed. In 20 + years as a dealer, this is the first copy I have ever had.\\nValores faciales: 10.0 pesos. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: blue, green. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird. \\nPrecios: c5, c2.\\n\\nBonilla and Saenz report the 10 peso up with a (hand stamped) \"Muestra\" overprint.

      "James A. Quigley Part I) (As printed in Weekly Philatelic Gossip, June 16, 1945\\nFechas: 1945.\\n\\nOften the story behind the stamps is of more interest than the dry listing in the catalogue would seem to indicate. Such is certainly the case in regard to the Costa Rican issue of 1907. This set.is listed by Scott as numbers 59 to 68. The stamps surcharged OFICIAL and listed as numbers 048 to 055 were produced by the same manufacturer under the same contract and should be regarded as part of the same issue. Likewise, the telegraph stamps Scotts type A62 used later to produce the surcharges of 1911 were part of this same issue. A set of revenue stamps were also produced by the same engraving firm. And thereby hangs a tale as the story writers say.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: A 62. \\nFechas: 1907, 1911. \\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: engraved. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine.\\n\\nAround the turn of the century the engraving and printing firm of Waterlow Brothers and Layton Ltd., was established in London. One is immediately struck by the similarity in name between this firm and the old established house of Waterlow and Sons. It is not known that Waterlow Brothers and Layton deliberately intended to make use of this sim- ilarity in name, but at any rate just such a confusion as could be anticipated was made by the Costa Rican authorities. Waterlow Brothers and Layton sent an agent to San Jose to solicit business from the Costa Rican Government. Under the impression that this agent represented the old reputable firm of Waterlow and Sons a contract was entered into for the production of a series of postage, telegraph, official and revenue stamps.\\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: engraved. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: red.\\n\\nThis issue was authorized by Decree #2 dated September 28, 1907. The first day of issue was October 1st. The stamps were well manufactured on a good grade of paper and with their pleasing two color combination are a fine addition to any collectors album.\\nFechas: 1907. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine. \\nColores: red.\\n\\nAll went well until March, 1910. At that time the authorities uncovered a con- spiracy to defraud the National Treasury by the sale of revenue stamps by private parties. These revenue stamps were apparently similar in every respect to those in the hands of the National Treasury. The conclusion was at once reached that the stamps in the hands of the conspirators were produced from the original plates which were supposed to be in the custody of the manufacturers in London. Further investigation revealed that the par- ties to the conspiracy were a prominent government official who held a position of trust in the National Stamp Office and some persons in the offices of the stamp manufacturers in London. These findings were verified when it was ascertained that the stamps illegally sold were not abstracted from the Government vaults but had been smuggled into Costa Rica from an outside source.\\nFechas: 1910. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: red.\\n\\nAs a measure of security the revenue stamps were immediately demonetized. The local press immediately began to agitate for the recall of all the issues manufactured by Waterlow Brothers and Layton: The Government acceded to this agitation and the postal issue was likewise recalled and demonetized. As soon as the manufacturers learned that the Government had recalled the issue they began to sell these stamps openly. The\\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: red.\\n\\nstamps thus sold irregularly were principally those mentioned in footnotes in Scott and Gibbons catalogues, 1.e. imperforate and inverted center, and on various colored papers.\\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: imperforate. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado good. \\nVariedades EFO: centro invertido (confianza: 0.9); sin dentar (confianza: 0.8). \\nColores: red.\\n\\nIt may be of'interest to note the various quantities of each denomination of this issue that were delivered by the manufacturers.\\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: red. \n",

      "         üìù Texto: BY GIANA WAYMAN\\n\\nStrangely the first two revenue issues of Costa Rica are the most common. In fact the second issue is the only general revenue set that is easy to complete and even sheets are not too difficult to find. However, this is deceptive as there are many interesting complications and some important rarities.\\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nThese two issues were lithographed by Bradbury, Wilkinson and Co. of England in sheets of 40 (10 x 40), perf 14.5 and they were imperf. at the edges. There was one general plate for the frames and the values in numbers and letters were added in a second plate. The 5c is in red and the others are in black. The frames must have been printed all at once as there are little or no shade variations.\\nValores faciales: 5.0 c. \\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: dentado 14.5/10x40, imperforate, lithography. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: red, black. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nGum is very thick on the first issue and color is beige and yellow. It is ‚Äú crinkled ‚Äù with lines and ridges over the surface, sometimes more pronounced than others. It may cause the front of the stamp to also have lines and wrinkles. fine brush lines in the gum indicates that it was applied by hand. It is quite possible that the stamps were shipped by the printer without gum, which was applied in CR. as needed. This would explain the large number of mint stamps, including sheets, which show no indication of ever having had gum applied.\\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: yellow. \\nDise√±os: barco/ship/vessel, ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nBradbury reported having printed 100,000 to 200,000 of the values to 25 pesos but only 1,000 each of the 50 & 100 peso stamps. The rarity of these two high values supports this.\\nValores faciales: 25.0 pesos, 100.0 pesos. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nThe stamps were authorized from March 1, 1870 but their use was abolished only 3 months later on June 2. This creates the first rarity; copies used during this period. Bonilla reports a 10c with an April 8 th date and I can report a 25c with a (Mar) 29/70 date (fig. 2 ). They both correspond to the decree requiring that the stamps be canceled with a signature and date. This is a rarity a collector might find with a large amount of luck and a small amount of money.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: A 10c, 25c. \\nFechas: 1870. \\nValores faciales: 10.0 c, 25.0 c. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine. \\nPrecios: c1, c2. \n",

      "         üìù Texto: BY GIANA WAYMAN\\n\\nStrangely the first two revenue issues of Costa Rica are the most common. In fact the second issue is the only general revenue set that is easy to complete and even sheets are not too difficult to find. However, this is deceptive as there are many interesting complications and some important rarities.\\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nThese two issues were lithographed by Bradbury, Wilkinson and Co. of England in sheets of 40 (10 x 40), perf 14.5 and they were imperf. at the edges. There was one general plate for the frames and the values in numbers and letters were added in a second plate. The 5c is in red and the others are in black. The frames must have been printed all at once as there are little or no shade variations.\\nValores faciales: 5.0 c. \\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: dentado 14.5/10x40, imperforate, lithography. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: red, black. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nGum is very thick on the first issue and color is beige and yellow. It is ‚Äú crinkled ‚Äù with lines and ridges over the surface, sometimes more pronounced than others. It may cause the front of the stamp to also have lines and wrinkles. fine brush lines in the gum indicates that it was applied by hand. It is quite possible that the stamps were shipped by the printer without gum, which was applied in CR. as needed. This would explain the large number of mint stamps, including sheets, which show no indication of ever having had gum applied.\\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: yellow. \\nDise√±os: barco/ship/vessel, ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nBradbury reported having printed 100,000 to 200,000 of the values to 25 pesos but only 1,000 each of the 50 & 100 peso stamps. The rarity of these two high values supports this.\\nValores faciales: 25.0 pesos, 100.0 pesos. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nThe stamps were authorized from March 1, 1870 but their use was abolished only 3 months later on June 2. This creates the first rarity; copies used during this period. Bonilla reports a 10c with an April 8 th date and I can report a 25c with a (Mar) 29/70 date (fig. 2 ). They both correspond to the decree requiring that the stamps be canceled with a signature and date. This is a rarity a collector might find with a large amount of luck and a small amount of money.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: A 10c, 25c. \\nFechas: 1870. \\nValores faciales: 10.0 c, 25.0 c. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine. \\nPrecios: c1, c2.\\n\\nThe 50c with green frame does exist. the color is identical to the light green of the 25c so it is almost certainly an actual error and not an essay. The ‚Äúgreen‚Äù, listed by Bonilla for the 10 peso is actually a blue-green and completely different. This stamp is a great rarity, Certainly not more than one sheet existed. In 20 + years as a dealer, this is the first copy I have ever had.\\nValores faciales: 10.0 pesos. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: blue, green. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird. \\nPrecios: c5, c2.\\n\\nBonilla and Saenz report the 10 peso up with a (hand stamped) \"Muestra\" overprint.

One explanation for the short life of the set relates to a scandal involving the concurrent revenue stamps from the same printer (Waterlow Brothers and Layton), but this explanation has been challenged. Whatever the reason, the remainder stock consisted of about one million of the 5 centimos stamps and between 300,000 ‚Äî 400,000 each of the 1, 2 and 10 centimos stamps. $^1$\\nFechas: 1910, 1907. \\nValores faciales: 5.0 centimos, 10.0 centimos. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine. \\nColores: red. \\nPrecios:  centavos5,  centavos10.\\n\\nWhen supplies of the low values of the 1910 issue (Sc # 69-76) became exhausted the 1907 remainder stock was overprinted as replace- ments (Sc # 77-84) by Banco de Costa Rica on a small press at the Department of Fiscal Species. ‚Äú ...employees charged with the job turned out to be poor printers, and as a result there arose the interminable errors and fantasies which charac- terize these surcharges ‚Äù is how Peralta de- scribed the print job.

COHEN\\n\\nFor many years, I along with many other collectors of Costa Rica, have been mystified by the fact that at least 50 percent of the high values of the 1907 set of Costa Rica (Scott 66/68) on the market are cancelled with appro- ximately one-quarter of the black target cancel. The entire set, which is illustrated here, has these cancels. Since this set appeared with the first issue of telegraph stamps, printed by the same firm as these postal adhesives it could hardly be assumed that the target cancels represented telegraphic use.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 66. \\nFechas: 1907. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine. \\nColores: red, black. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nThe 1907 Set Showing One-Quarter Use of the Target Cancel\\nFechas: 1907. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \n",

      "Albert J. Hart\\n\\nYears ago I luckily found a copy of Scott 017 with gum, and added it to my collection. It is one of the most difficult acquisitions I made in accumulating my collection of Costa Rica stamps. My stamp did have gum but not much. Only one stamp was left on my list of difficult stamps needed to complete my collection.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 017. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nThe list had been made decades ago and there were some exclusions. Lack of interest excluded Guanacaste, legitimacy of the 1907 issue with inverted centers another, and extreme scarcity (the 1921 Vendetti Flight cover) coupled with the lack of money was another. With only one stamp left on the list, the Final Frontier loomed large and final.\\nFechas: 1921, 1907. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nPer√≠odo Guanacaste 1885-1891. \\nSignificado hist√≥rico: 1885-1891 Guanacaste overprint period. \n",
