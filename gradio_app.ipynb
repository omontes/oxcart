I can almost definitely state that setting No. 2 was used in the se- cond printing and was employed exclu- sively to make the double surcharge, i.e. Scott's 80b, Gibbons' 90b and Yvert's 75c, on Yvert's No. 75b, that is to say, the stamp perforated 11 x 14. Further on this will be discussed in detail.\n",

      "         üìù Texto: ONE OF THE RAREST STAMPS OF COSTA RICA.\\n\\nOutside of the Guanacaste vertical overprints & the inverted centers of the 1907 issue, by far the rarest stamp of Costa Rica is the 10c \"Official\" of 1886, Scott 0-17. Have not seen a mint or o.g. copy for over thirty years! Unused copies, i.e. without gum, can occasionally be found. However, since the earlier official stamps of Costa Rica were not cancelled (in Costa Rica) when used on offi- cial m_ail, this accounts for the unused copies. No information is available as to the number of 0-16 and 0-17 issued. The number must have been quite small.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 0-17. \\nFechas: 1886, 1907. \\nValores faciales: 10.0 c. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine. \\nPer√≠odo Guanacaste 1885-1891. \\nSignificado hist√≥rico: 1885-1891 Guanacaste overprint period. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird. \\nPrecios: c1.\\n\\nForgeries of the overprint can easily be told in that the dot over the second \"i\" is round instead of square or slightly rectangular.\n",

      "Albert J. Hart\\n\\nIn 1975 Alex A. Cohen asked the following question in the Oxcart under the heading ‚ÄúA mystery overprint‚Äù ref (1):\\nFechas: 1975. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\n‚Äú Recently, I noted the 2 and 5 colon values of the 1901 issue (Scott nos. 52 and 53 ) with a blue, single-line overprint, in caps, reading Ultramar. This is the first time I have ever seen these. Can any member furnish any information concerning them? ‚Äù\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 52. \\nFechas: 1901. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: blue. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nIn the next issue of the Oxcart ref (2) a letter from C. Angus Parker (1927 - 1995) , a British collector, dealer, and SOCORICO member, explained that the overprint was a hand struck cachet applied by Portuguese postal authorities to stamps circulated through the universal postal union (UPU) in Switzerland. The ‚Äúultamar stamps‚Äù were circulated to Portuguese overseas colonies and post offices as a security precaution.\\nFechas: 1927, 1995. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine.\\n\\nIn the next Oxcart ref (3), Cohen reported that he had met Parker and shown him the ultramar stamps. Parker, a specialist in this field, told Cohen the stamps were genuine, showing him Salvador stamps with the same overprint. Parker said both Spain and Portugal distributed stamps received from the UPU to their colonies with applied overprints at the turn of the century. Spain applied ‚ÄúColonias‚Äù and Portugal ‚Äúultramar‚Äù. Parker added that these overprints were quite scarce. Later that year more ultramar overprints were reported (Scott 61, 045, 046, and 047) in the Oxcart ref (4).\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 61, 045, 046. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nIn 1978 the ‚Äú ultramars ‚Äù were back as lot 125 of the Oxcart mail bid sale No 73 ref (5): the 1907 1c to 2 colone, (59/68) mixed perfs.

Both the 14 x 14 and 11 x 14 perforations are known to have been used early in the life of the 1907 set, so the ‚Äú mixed perfs ‚Äù , is not unusual ref 6). Cohen was the sales manager at this time and had probably brought this lot (which sold for $ 510,00) from Europe and in 1980 he showed, ref (7) a photograph of the 1907 ultramar set fig (1).

Included in the sale were 137 lots which had originated in Angola, a former Portuguese overseas territory. Stamps in these lots were UPU samples from nations around the world with the ultamar hand stamp as well as five other hand stamps used in later periods.

      "Albert J. Hart\\n\\nIn 1975 Alex A. Cohen asked the following question in the Oxcart under the heading ‚ÄúA mystery overprint‚Äù ref (1):\\nFechas: 1975. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\n‚Äú Recently, I noted the 2 and 5 colon values of the 1901 issue (Scott nos. 52 and 53 ) with a blue, single-line overprint, in caps, reading Ultramar. This is the first time I have ever seen these. Can any member furnish any information concerning them? ‚Äù\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 52. \\nFechas: 1901. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: blue. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird.\\n\\nIn the next issue of the Oxcart ref (2) a letter from C. Angus Parker (1927 - 1995) , a British collector, dealer, and SOCORICO member, explained that the overprint was a hand struck cachet applied by Portuguese postal authorities to stamps circulated through the universal postal union (UPU) in Switzerland. The ‚Äúultamar stamps‚Äù were circulated to Portuguese overseas colonies and post offices as a security precaution.\\nFechas: 1927, 1995. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine.\\n\\nIn the next Oxcart ref (3), Cohen reported that he had met Parker and shown him the ultramar stamps. Parker, a specialist in this field, told Cohen the stamps were genuine, showing him Salvador stamps with the same overprint. Parker said both Spain and Portugal distributed stamps received from the UPU to their colonies with applied overprints at the turn of the century. Spain applied ‚ÄúColonias‚Äù and Portugal ‚Äúultramar‚Äù. Parker added that these overprints were quite scarce. Later that year more ultramar overprints were reported (Scott 61, 045, 046, and 047) in the Oxcart ref (4).\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 61, 045, 046. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nIn 1978 the ‚Äú ultramars ‚Äù were back as lot 125 of the Oxcart mail bid sale No 73 ref (5): the 1907 1c to 2 colone, (59/68) mixed perfs. All with target cancel in black in one corner, circulated as specimens through UPU, with\\nFechas: 1978, 1907. \\nValores faciales: 2.0 colones. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: black.\\n\\nHand stamp ultramar, i.e. ‚Äúoverseas‚Äù, security marking applied by Portuguese PO to stamps sent to it‚Äôs colonies and post offices abroad. A Real rarity. Estimated value $500,00‚Äù.\\nCondici√≥n: centrado good. \\nPrecios: $500,00.\\n\\nThe target cancels were applied in Costa Rica, probably as a security precaution to deter the stamps from passing to individuals who otherwise could use them to defraud the post office. Both the 14 x 14 and 11 x 14 perforations are known to have been used early in the life of the 1907 set, so the ‚Äú mixed perfs ‚Äù , is not unusual ref 6). Cohen was the sales manager at this time and had probably brought this lot (which sold for $ 510,00) from Europe and in 1980 he showed, ref (7) a photograph of the 1907 ultramar set fig (1). I have found no mention of the ultramar overprint in the Oxcart since that time.\\nFechas: 1980, 1907. \\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: dentado 14x14/14/11x14. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine. \\nDise√±os: ave/p√°jaro/bird. \\nPrecios: $ 510,00.\\n\\nThe George Alevizos public auction of July 7, 1994 brought new light to this dark corner of Costa Rican philately. Included in the sale were 137 lots which had originated in Angola, a former Portuguese overseas territory. Stamps in these lots were UPU samples from nations around the world with the ultamar hand stamp as well as five other hand stamps used in later periods. The auction catalogue defined the six Portuguese hand stamps and their period of use:\\nFechas: 1994. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine. \\nColores: dark, light.\\n\\n0\t1\n",

One explanation for the short life of the set relates to a scandal involving the concurrent revenue stamps from the same printer (Waterlow Brothers and Layton), but this explanation has been challenged. Whatever the reason, the remainder stock consisted of about one million of the 5 centimos stamps and between 300,000 ‚Äî 400,000 each of the 1, 2 and 10 centimos stamps. $^1$\\nFechas: 1910, 1907. \\nValores faciales: 5.0 centimos, 10.0 centimos. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine. \\nColores: red. \\nPrecios:  centavos5,  centavos10.\\n\\nWhen supplies of the low values of the 1910 issue (Sc # 69-76) became exhausted the 1907 remainder stock was overprinted as replace- ments (Sc # 77-84) by Banco de Costa Rica on a small press at the Department of Fiscal Species. ‚Äú ...employees charged with the job turned out to be poor printers, and as a result there arose the interminable errors and fantasies which charac- terize these surcharges ‚Äù is how Peralta de- scribed the print job.

He later says: ‚Äú For the purpose of identifying these, the favor cancella- tion invariably applied ‚Äì to these and all the rest of the speculative stamps of this issue ‚Äì is the long rectangle that was in use in that period, with the legend ‚Äú San Jose, C.

The event prompt- ing my inquiry was Scott's 2003 catalogue in- crease of the valuation of the ‚Äú used ‚Äù stamp to $ 100 from zero in the past two years. In years prior to 2000 it had a value as high as $ 125. The stamp in question is Scott # 87 (Mena 84, 84A). The question is whether or not this stamp ever saw postal use? Or put another way, what is it one is likely to buy when spending $ 100 for this ‚Äú used ‚Äù stamp? A summary of my brief re- view of the existing literature follows.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: Scott 2003, 87. \\nFechas: 2000, 2003, 1907, 1911. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine, defectos: crease. \\nColores: blue, black. \\nPrecios: $ 100, $ 125., $ 100.\\n\\nDecree No. 228 of November 11, 1910 author ized the surcharging of 285,000 telegraph stamps of 1910 of different values with ‚Äú Correos ‚Äì Un centimo ‚Äù : an issue date of Novem ber 14, 1911 is given in Mena. $^1$\\nFechas: 1910, 1911. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine.\\n\\nTwo plates were used in the surcharging op- eration. Plate 1 (narrow character spacing) was used on six of the seven values.

He later says: ‚Äú For the purpose of identifying these, the favor cancella- tion invariably applied ‚Äì to these and all the rest of the speculative stamps of this issue ‚Äì is the long rectangle that was in use in that period, with the legend ‚Äú San Jose, C.

      "James A. Quigley Part I) (As printed in Weekly Philatelic Gossip, June 16, 1945\\nFechas: 1945.\\n\\nOften the story behind the stamps is of more interest than the dry listing in the catalogue would seem to indicate. Such is certainly the case in regard to the Costa Rican issue of 1907. This set.is listed by Scott as numbers 59 to 68. The stamps surcharged OFICIAL and listed as numbers 048 to 055 were produced by the same manufacturer under the same contract and should be regarded as part of the same issue. Likewise, the telegraph stamps Scotts type A62 used later to produce the surcharges of 1911 were part of this same issue. A set of revenue stamps were also produced by the same engraving firm. And thereby hangs a tale as the story writers say.\\nCat√°logos internacionales: A 62. \\nFechas: 1907, 1911. \\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: engraved. \\nCondici√≥n: used, centrado fine.\\n\\nAround the turn of the century the engraving and printing firm of Waterlow Brothers and Layton Ltd., was established in London. One is immediately struck by the similarity in name between this firm and the old established house of Waterlow and Sons. It is not known that Waterlow Brothers and Layton deliberately intended to make use of this sim- ilarity in name, but at any rate just such a confusion as could be anticipated was made by the Costa Rican authorities. Waterlow Brothers and Layton sent an agent to San Jose to solicit business from the Costa Rican Government. Under the impression that this agent represented the old reputable firm of Waterlow and Sons a contract was entered into for the production of a series of postage, telegraph, official and revenue stamps.\\nEspecificaciones t√©cnicas: engraved. \\nCondici√≥n: centrado fine. \\nColores: red.\\n\\nThis issue was authorized by Decree #2 dated September 28, 1907. The first day of issue was October 1st. The stamps were well manufactured on a good grade of paper and with their pleasing two color combination are a fine addition to any collectors album.\\nFechas: 1907. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine. \\nColores: red.\\n\\nAll went well until March, 1910. At that time the authorities uncovered a con- spiracy to defraud the National Treasury by the sale of revenue stamps by private parties. These revenue stamps were apparently similar in every respect to those in the hands of the National Treasury. The conclusion was at once reached that the stamps in the hands of the conspirators were produced from the original plates which were supposed to be in the custody of the manufacturers in London. Further investigation revealed that the par- ties to the conspiracy were a prominent government official who held a position of trust in the National Stamp Office and some persons in the offices of the stamp manufacturers in London. These findings were verified when it was ascertained that the stamps illegally sold were not abstracted from the Government vaults but had been smuggled into Costa Rica from an outside source.\n",

Whatever the reason, the remainder stock consisted of about one million of the 5 centimos stamps and between 300,000 ‚Äî 400,000 each of the 1, 2 and 10 centimos stamps. $^1$\\nFechas: 1910, 1907. \\nValores faciales: 5.0 centimos, 10.0 centimos. \\nCondici√≥n: cancelled to order, centrado fine. \\nColores: red. \\nPrecios:  centavos5,  centavos10.\\n\\nWhen supplies of the low values of the 1910 issue (Sc # 69-76) became exhausted the 1907 remainder stock was overprinted as replace- ments (Sc # 77-84) by Banco de Costa Rica on a small press at the Department of Fiscal Species. ‚Äú ...employees charged with the job turned out to be poor printers, and as a result there arose the interminable errors and fantasies which charac- terize these surcharges ‚Äù is how Peralta de- scribed the print job.
